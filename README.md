# Plant-Disease-Flask-WebApp
AI WebApp using Tensorflow and Flask 
In this project I have built a WebApp that detects diseases on a plant leaf. <br />
There are various technologies involved, but the main idea is to have an API server running for the backend and using a frontend React WebApp.<br /> <br />
